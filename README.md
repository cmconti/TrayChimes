# TrayChimes

Tray Chimes is a utility which can play chimes on the quarter hour and sound an alarm with a message dialog popup.



The configuration UI is accessible via right clicking or double clicking the TrayChimes icon in the system tray.



TODO:

1. Add silent hours for chimes
2. Add mute (also cancel any currently playing chimes/alarms)
3. Modernize UI
4. Better alarm controls/granularity (e.g. weekday only, multiple alarms, etc.)
5. Better icons and graphics
6. Fix snooze with 'play alarm once'
7. Github actions to build and to create release
8. Handle Win10+ light/dark mode
9. Update root readme.md
